# Alexia's Data Analytics Portfolio

# [Project 1: Cyclistic Company](https://github.com/alexiavalencial/project_1_cyclistic.git)
This is a project I did for my Data Analytics Course by Google, where I analyzed data from the company records and built a recommendation to convert casual customers to annual membership customers.

- Data was taken from a primary source
- Data was cleaned and filtered using spreadsheets
- Google spreadsheet was used to complete the analysis
- Tableau was used to process necessary graphs for visualization purposes
- Recommendations to the Marketing Department were provided based on the results
