# Project 1: Cyclistic

This is a project I did for my Data Analytics Course by Google, where I analyzed data from the company records and built a recommendation to convert casual customers to annual membership customers.

## Introduction

The bicycle rental sector has grown exponentially in recent years, due to its economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, they have also had to face various challenges, such as the declining economy and keeping their audience with them, preventing them from going with the competition or using other types of transportation.

**Scenario**

This practical case is based on a fictitious company called “Cyclistic”, which offers a bicycle rental service in Chicago, United States. Its mission is to provide a more economical, healthy, and sustainable transportation alternative for citizens.

Cyclistic has flexible pricing plans to meet consumer needs. Customers who obtain a single trip or daily pass are considered **casual** customers, while those who opt for annual memberships are considered **members**.

The marketing director believes that the future success of the company depends on getting casual customers to acquire memberships, thus increasing the number of annual members.
To support business decisions, it is necessary to analyze data from the last 12 months.

The question that will guide this analysis will be the following:
How are annual members and casual cyclists different regarding using Cyclistic bikes?

The following tools were used to answer this question: spreadsheets to clean and analyze the monthly data, and Tableau to visualize the results obtained.

The analysis focused on the variables related to user preference (duration, frequency, and day of trips), making a distinction between casual customers and members.

**Data Source**

The historical data used for the analysis corresponds to a period of 12 months, from December 1, 2022, to November 30, 2023. This data was provided by Motivate International Inc., a bicycle rental company located in the city of Chicago, United States. It contains information about the trips made by users, including the month, day, and time the trip started and ended, as well as the type of bicycle used.

The data is available for free download and can be consulted in the following "[link to the data source](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)”, under this “[link to the license agreement](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)”.

**Data Credibility**

The data source was classified as reliable because it comes from a primary source. The company that provides the service is responsible for collecting the data and storing it for later analysis.

## Prepare data for analysis**

It was necessary to convert the files from .csv to .xlsx to run the analysis in the spreadsheet program.

**Identify the structure of the data**

Data distribution format:
- Each file corresponded to a month, each of them consisted of 13 columns and the number of rows varied depending on the trips made in said month.
Trip details:
- The ride_id column contains unique identifiers for each ride.
- The rideable_type column indicates what type of bicycle was used on each trip.
- The started_at and ended_at columns record the start and end date and time of each trip.
Station information:
- The start_station_name and end_station_name columns contain the names of the start and end stations, respectively. However, it is observed that some of these cells are empty, suggesting that information is not available for all stations.
- The columns start_station_id and end_station_id contain station identifiers, and it is also observed that some cells are empty.
Geospatial information:
- The start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, and end_lng columns contain latitude and longitude data for the start and end locations of each trip.
Type of user:
- The column member_casual records the type of user who took each trip, with values such as “Member” and “Casual”.

## Data processing

To keep the data separated by month, it was decided to do an individual analysis for each file.

**Data Cleaning**

The following precautions were taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis:

1. The “rideable_type” columns were filtered to validate that there were only valid values (classic_bike, docked_bike, electric_bike) and the “member_casual” column to corroborate, in the same way, that there are only two types of entries (member and casual). Those rows where any of this data was empty were eliminated to avoid any bias or margin of error.
2. The started_at and ended_at columns were converted to the same date (yyyy-mm-dd) and time (hh:mm:ss) format.

**Add specific information**

Seven new columns with basic metrics were added to facilitate the identification of trends and patterns in travel:

1. ride_length: To calculate the duration of the trips, the operation of subtracting the “ended_at” column from “started_at” was performed.
- It was decided to eliminate those trips with a duration of 0 seconds and negative values to avoid information that did not add value or affect the analysis.
2. Day of week: the formula “=WEEKDAY(C:C,1)” was applied to record the day of the week on which said trip was executed, where 1 is equivalent to Sunday and 7 to Saturday.
3. # of trips: the formula “=COUNT(O:O)” was used to determine the total number of trips made, as well as the formulas “=COUNTIF(M:M,"MEMBER")” and “=COUNTIF(M: M,"casual")” to determine how many of those trips were taken by members and casual customers.
4. avg_ride_length: This column added the average length of total trips, as well as trips taken by members and casual customers. The formulas used in this column were: “=AVERAGE(N:N)”, “=AVERAGEIF(M:M, "member",N:N)” and “=AVERAGEIF(M:M,"casual", N: N)” respectively.
5. Most_common_day: “=MODE(O:O)” was used to find the day of the week with the most total trips. A small table was also added to count the number of trips made per day and segment by the type of customer (member or casual), this was carried out using the formula “=COUNTIFS”.
6. Members% and casual%: in this pair of columns a division was made between the number of clients according to their type and the total number of trips made, to have a clearer idea of the percentage that each type of client represents.
7. Another small table was added using the same “=COUNTIFS” formula, to count the type of bicycle used by both types of clients.
8. Finally, a pivot table was added in a different sheet (Avg ride_length p/d), with the average trip duration according to the day and type of customer.
All of these analyses helped us better understand user behaviors depending on the day and type of customer.

## Data frame analysis.

**All data**

A [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1quTg1X3cOns02grdMN5VZNOeJ9SAv6CPP98zO5htOTo/edit) was specifically designated to establish a data set including all the columns created in the twelve files analyzed, to facilitate access and analysis by detecting trends.

From this data, we can see that in twelve months, 5,677,524 travel data were collected. It is observed that Tuesday was the day with the most trips recorded throughout the year. The average duration of the trips was approximately 16 minutes and 21 seconds. However, there are extremely high values, an example is a trip found of 560 hours with 03 minutes and 44 seconds, and other trips with a duration of 01 or 02 seconds, which could be considered atypical. 

**Comparison of trip duration statistics between “Members” and “Casual” users**

Of the total trips collected, 3,625,154 (67.47%) were users with annual memberships and 2,052,370 (32.53%) were casual customers.

Average duration:
Members: 12 minutes and 01 seconds.
Casual: 25 minutes and 52 seconds.

This indicates that, on average, casual users have significantly longer trips compared to member users. The average trip duration for occasional users has increased by 96%.

Most frequent day of the week:
Members: 3 (Tuesday).
Casual: 7 (Saturday).

In casual clients, a slight preference for weekends was observed. Unlike member customers, who usually use the service on weekdays.

Average duration per day:

Using the results of pivot tables, a significant increase in the duration of trips on weekends was detected for both users, with a notable peak on Saturdays.

## Data visualization

A graph was made to represent the number of total trips and number of trips by members and casual users.
